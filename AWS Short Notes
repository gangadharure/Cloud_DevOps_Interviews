AWS EC2 offers 5 types of instances which are as follows:

	General Instances
		- For applications that require a balance of performance and cost.
		  - E.g email responding systems, where you need a prompt response as well as the it should be cost effective, since it doesnâ€™t require much processing.
		  - Size: (T2, T3,T3a, M6g, M6i, M6a, M5, M5a, M5n, M5zn, A1, M4, etc..)
		  
   Compute Instance 
        - For applucation that require a lot of processing from the CPU.
		  - E.g - analysis of data from a stream of data, like Twitter stream.
		  - Size: (C7g, C6g, C6gn, C6i, C5, C5a, C5n, C4, etc.. )
   
   Memory Instances
		- For application that are heavy in nature, therefore, require a lot of RAM.
			- E.g when your system needs a lot of applications running in the background i.e multitasking.
   			 - Size: (R6g, R6i, R5a, R5, R5b, R5n, R4, X2gd, X1, X1e, HIgh Memory, z1d etc..)
			 
   Storage instances
   		- For application that are huge in size or have a data set that occupies a lot of space.
			- E.g When your applications is of huge size.
			 - Size: ()
			 
	GPU instance
		- FOr applications that require asome heavy graphics rendering.
			- E.g #D modelling etc.
			 - Size: ()
